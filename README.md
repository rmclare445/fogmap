# fogmap

Retrieves live insolation data from around the Monterey Peninsula and compares values to insolation nowcasts.  

We live in a very foggy part of the country and while it can be nice, so much can get old.  Deciding what to do during a foggy day at home would be made easier if all of the insolation data for the surrounding area were readily available and conveniently displayed.  Sometimes the sun is out just up the road and it would be nice to know that.  Fortunately Weather Underground hosts solar radiation data from a respectable number of home weather stations in the area.

I have completed the first part of my mission: the web scraper, insolation estimate calculator, and associated metrics.  Now I have to figure out and develop the display element and maybe a few other things.
